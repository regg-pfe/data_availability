# data_availability

Although free data availability not only promotes transparency in scientific research, but also facilitates replication, reduces the cost of ressources and increases access to collaboration and funding, to a great extent, the incentive to provide open access to all data, methods and materials is still lacking in todayâ€™s scientific community. 

To investigate to what part data is made freely available in open scientific research, the aim of this study is to ascertain the percentage of articles that actually provide open access to all sources, materials, methods and data, in comparison to those that only provide partial access and those that in turn disallow the user to access the data all together.
